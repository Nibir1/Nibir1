### Hi There, I'm Nahasat Nibir

## AI Systems Engineer | Generative AI, RAG & Agentic Workflows

**M.Sc. Student in Artificial Intelligence** at the University of Jyväskylä.

I bridge the gap between **AI Research** and **Production Engineering**. With a background in high-performance computing and simulation (8+ years), I now architect secure, scalable **AI Infrastructure**. I specialize in building **Agentic Workflows** and **Enterprise RAG Systems** that prioritize governance, safety, and reliability over simple "demos."
