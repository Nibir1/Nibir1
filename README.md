**Generative AI Engineer | Full-Stack Developer | Golang & LLM Systems Specialist**

In the era of **Data and Generative AI**, the possibilities to create meaningful change are limitless.  
I design and build **LLM-powered applications and intelligent systems** that transform raw data into insight, automation, and real-world business value.

With 8+ years of software engineering experience spanning **video game development**, **backend systems**, and **AI engineering**, I specialize in bridging human intent with machine reasoning — combining robust infrastructure, scalable APIs, and advanced AI reasoning into cohesive products.

### 🧠 Generative AI & Systems Engineering
1. **LLM-Powered Applications:** Chatbots, copilots, summarizers, and autonomous agents using local or hosted models (Llama, Mistral, Gemma, OpenAI).  
2. **RAG Architectures:** Document ingestion, chunking, embeddings, vector stores (FAISS, Pinecone, Milvus), hybrid retrieval, and answer synthesis.  
3. **Prompt Engineering & Tool Calling:** Structured prompts, multi-step agent orchestration, and API/function chaining.  
4. **LLMOps Foundations:** Prompt versioning, evaluation pipelines (RAGAS/DeepEval), A/B testing, telemetry, and continuous improvement workflows.  
5. **AI Safety & Governance:** Grounding, policy enforcement, content filtering, PII redaction, hallucination control, and Responsible AI practices.  
6. **Model Deployment:** Experience with self-hosted inference (Ollama, llama.cpp) and cloud platforms (Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Vertex AI).  
7. **Performance & Optimization:** Quantization (GGUF, ONNX), caching, concurrency, streaming, and low-latency inference optimization.

### ⚙️ Backend & Infrastructure Engineering
1. **Languages/Frameworks:** Golang (Fiber, Gin), Python (FastAPI), Node.js (Express.js).  
2. **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Redis, vector databases for RAG systems.  
3. **Cloud & DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (EKS, RDS, ECR, IAM, Secrets Manager), CI/CD pipelines.  
4. **Architecture Design:** REST APIs, event-driven systems, distributed microservices, concurrency and scaling strategies.

### 💻 Frontend Engineering
- **React.js + Vite + TypeScript** for modern, responsive AI interfaces.  
- Real-time chat UIs, streaming LLM outputs, and data-driven dashboards.  
- Strong emphasis on user experience, accessibility, and performance.

---

### 🧩 Systems Programming & CLI Development
- Cross-platform CLI applications integrating local AI inference and retrieval pipelines.  
- Secure command orchestration with directory sandboxing, tokenized validation, and concurrent worker design.  

---

### 🎮 Game Development & 3D Art (Previous Expertise)
- **Unreal Engine 5 (C++ & Blueprint)**, **VR development**, and immersive experience design.  
- 3D asset creation with **Maya, Substance Painter, ZBrush**, and **Megascans**.

---

### 🎓 Education
Currently pursuing a **Master’s in Artificial Intelligence** at the **University of Jyväskylä, Finland**. My academic focus is on **LLM architectures, AI safety, and retrieval-augmented reasoning**.
