### Hi, I'm Nahasat Nibir.

## AI Solutions Architect | M.Sc. Artificial Intelligence
**University of Jyväskylä, Finland**

**Bridging the gap between AI Research and Production Engineering.**

I am an **AI Systems Architect** specializing in building production-grade Generative AI platforms. With a background in **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** and **Simulation**, I don't just wrap APIs - I build secure, cost-optimized, and observable AI infrastructure.

I focus on **"Day 2" Operations**: Governance, FinOps (Cost Modeling), Latency Optimization, and Role-Based Security.

## Architectural Portfolio

My repositories are **Reference Architectures**, not just demos. Each includes **C4 Models, ADRs (Decision Records), and Cost Analysis**.

### Enterprise Knowledge Management
* **[DocuMind-Enterprise](https://github.com/Nibir1/documind-enterprise)** | *Agentic RAG Platform*
    * **Architecture:** Asynchronous FastAPI + LangGraph State Machine.
    * **Key Pattern:** **Identity-Aware Retrieval**. Implements "Citation-First" governance to eliminate hallucinations in regulated industries.

* **[Meridian](https://github.com/Nibir1/Meridian)** | *Context Orchestration Engine*
    * **Architecture:** 4-Layer Cognitive Chain (Identity $\to$ Intent $\to$ Knowledge $\to$ Generation).
    * **Key Pattern:** **Row-Level Security (RLS)** for RAG. Filters vector retrieval based on user roles (CEO vs. CTO) to prevent data leaks.

### Industrial IoT & Digital Twins
* **[Swarm-Factory](https://github.com/Nibir1/Swarm-Factory)** | *Cloud-Native IIoT Platform*
    * **Architecture:** Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) on Azure (Event Hubs + Serverless Functions).
    * **Key Pattern:** **Spec-Driven Development**. Uses OpenAPI/AsyncAPI contracts to decouple high-velocity telemetry from dashboard visualization.
    
* **[Poseidon-Link](https://github.com/Nibir1/Poseidon-Link)** | *Polyglot Marine Control System*
    * **Architecture:** C++ (Physics) + Go (Telemetry) + React (UI).
    * **Key Pattern:** **Safety-Critical AI**. Uses a Go broker to sanitize AI voice commands before they reach the C++ physics engine.

### Hybrid Intelligence & Data
* **[Hyperion](https://github.com/Nibir1/Hyperion)** | *Physics-Guided Sales AI*
    * **Architecture:** Hybrid Intelligence (Vectorized Pandas + GPT-4o).
    * **Key Pattern:** **Zero-Hallucination**. Anchors Generative AI sales pitches to a deterministic physics simulation engine.

* **[Pipeline-X](https://github.com/Nibir1/Pipeline-X)** | *Hybrid Cloud Data Platform*
    * **Architecture:** Apache Spark (Big Data) + Airflow + Qdrant (Vector Search).
    * **Key Pattern:** **Unified Pipeline**. Orchestrates dual-stream processing to keep SQL Analytics and Vector Embeddings in sync.

## Engineering Philosophy

I believe in **Architecture over Implementation details**. My work is guided by:
* **The "Zero-Legacy" Mindset:** Every project includes `ADR` (Decision Records) so future teams understand *why* choices were made.
* **FinOps First:** AI is expensive. I implement token caching, routing, and quantization strategies to minimize OpEx.
* **Visual Communication:** I use **C4 Models** to translate code complexity for C-Level stakeholders.

## Technical Stack

* **AI & Orchestration:** Python, LangChain, LangGraph, Semantic Kernel, OpenAI, Ollama.
* **Vector Infrastructure:** Qdrant, Supabase (pgvector), Milvus.
* **Backend & Systems:** FastAPI (Python), Go (Golang), C++17, Apache Spark.
* **Cloud & DevOps:** Azure (Entra ID, Container Apps), Docker, Terraform (IaC), GitHub Actions.
* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Streamlit.
