Experienced Software Engineer | AI Systems & Full-Stack Development

With 8+ years in Software Engineering spanning Video Game Development (VR | PC | Mobile) and Full-Stack Web Development, I now specialize in building intelligent systems that bridge human intent with machine capability. My current focus is on AI-powered developer tools and local AI inference systems.

AI & Systems Engineering Expertise:

1. AI Engineering: Local AI inference systems, RAG architecture, prompt engineering, vector databases
2. LLM Integration: Direct llama.cpp bindings, model optimization, GGUF quantization, Metal framework acceleration
3. RAG Systems: Semantic search, document indexing, vector embeddings, similarity scoring (TF-IDF)
4. AI Safety: Multi-layer validation, dangerous pattern detection, command sanitization, risk assessment

Full-Stack & Cloud Engineering:

1. Back-End: Golang, Gin, Fiber, Python, FastAPI, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Redis
2. Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (IAM, RDS, ECR, EKS, Secrets Manager)
3. Front-End: React.js, Nextjs, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES5-ES2021), HTML5, CSS3

Systems Programming & CLI Development:

1. Command-Line Tools: Cross-platform CLI development, shell integration, terminal UX
2. Performance: Parallel processing, memory optimization, concurrent workers
3. Safety Systems: Directory sandboxing, command validation, quote balancing, execution restrictions

Video Game Development & 3D Art (Previous Expertise):

1. Game Engines: Unreal Engine 5, Blueprint & C++
2. 3D Modeling: Maya, ZBrush, Substance Painter, Megascans
3. VR Development: Immersive experiences, 3D environment creation

Currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence at University of Jyväskylä, Finland. I’m passionate about creating practical AI applications that solve real-world problems. My recent work includes Helix, an AI-powered CLI that uses RAG technology to understand natural language and system documentation—demonstrating my ability to deliver production-ready AI systems with enterprise-grade safety features.

I thrive at the intersection of cutting-edge AI research and practical software engineering, building tools that make complex technology accessible and safe for everyone.
